//Loops are computer programs that execute a set of instructions or a block of code a certain number of times without having to write it again until a certain condition is met. In other words, loops let your code execute one or more statements as many times as desired.

//For Loops in JavaScript
//The for loop is an iterative statement which you use to check for certain conditions and then repeatedly execute a block of code as long as those conditions are met.

for (initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body: statement
}

//Sample_program

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  let name = "John Doe";
  console.log("Hi, my name is " + name);
}

Output:

"Hi, my name is John Doe"
"Hi, my name is John Doe"
"Hi, my name is John Doe"
